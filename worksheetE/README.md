a)

num1 = 5
num2 = 7

result = 0 + 0
i = num1 + 0

while i != 0:
    result = result + num2
    i = i - 1

print(result)

b) The code has the effect of multiplying the values in $0 and $1, because the code runs through the while loop for 5 times (the value of
num1, and therefore, in my code $0), each time 7 is added to the result. So, effectivly, 7 is added 5 times, leaving us with 5 x 7 = 35.
